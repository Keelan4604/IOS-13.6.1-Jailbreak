# iOS 13.6.1 Jailbreak

I was able to successfully **jailbreak** my **iPhone X** running **iOS 13.6.1** using a **low-level bootrom exploit**. This exploit takes advantage of vulnerabilities in the hardware, making it extremely difficult for Apple to patch via software updates. Here’s a brief overview of how the jailbreak works and my future plans as it pertains to upgrading to newer devices.

## The Bootrom Exploit on iPhone X
The **iPhone X** was vulnerable to a bootrom exploit, which essentially allows for full control over the device at a low level. Since this type of exploit leverages hardware vulnerabilities, it provides a **permanent jailbreak**, regardless of future software updates from Apple. In my case, this allowed me to have full access to the system, bypass restrictions, install third-party applications, and customize the device in ways not possible on stock iOS.

Some of the benefits of jailbreaking my iPhone X include:
- **Customization**: Personalizing the UI, system tweaks, and app behavior to fit my preferences.
- **Access to Non-App Store Software**: Ability to install apps and tweaks not available in the official Apple App Store.
- **System Access**: Gaining root access to the file system for deeper modifications and control.

## Compatibility with Newer Devices
While the jailbreak worked flawlessly on my iPhone X, I'm aware that this same exploit will not be compatible with newer devices like the **iPhone 12**. The iPhone 12 comes preinstalled with **iOS 14** and is powered by the **A14 Bionic chip**, which does not share the same vulnerabilities as the iPhone X’s bootrom.

In short, the bootrom exploit is specific to certain hardware and cannot be applied to newer devices that have been patched or redesigned to avoid this security hole. As a result, upgrading to an iPhone 12 will mean losing the ability to use this particular jailbreak.

## Looking Forward
As Apple continues to improve its security measures, it is likely that jailbreaking will become more difficult, especially for newer models. While I enjoy the freedom of customization and control that jailbreaking provides, upgrading to newer hardware comes with trade-offs—more power and features at the cost of losing some of that low-level access.

For now, I’ll continue to enjoy the fully jailbroken experience on my iPhone X and keep an eye out for any new exploits or developments that may allow for future jailbreaking of newer devices like the iPhone 12.
